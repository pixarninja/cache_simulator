Compilation and Execution Instructions:

1. To compile, run the "make" command. The program uses the g++
   compiler with the c++11 build and some debugging flags. I have
   tested compilation on rainbow@nmt.edu and it successfully creates
   the executable file.

2. To run, type the executable name as you would any other
   executable (i.e. ./cachesim) followed by the configuration file
   path and the trace file path. The program will output a *.out
   file containing the requested quantities (5 lines in total) in
   the same order as they were in the PDF.
